# EA iCUE Widgets - Claude Code Reference

## Overview

This repo contains Edward Ayoub's custom iCUE widgets for Corsair LCD displays, built for iCUE's native widget system (Qt WebEngine / Chromium 130). All widgets are self-contained single-HTML-file applications with no external dependencies.

Reference material:
- `archive/upstream-snapshot-2026-09-12/`: local-only, gitignored snapshot of the 22 widgets, site page, and probe tools inherited from QuadraKev/QK-iCUE-Widgets (MIT). Use it as a pattern library (e.g. `widgets/EAWeather` for a fetch-based widget, `widgets/EAXEVisualizer` for a WebSocket companion server, `widgets/EAPaint` for a touch-heavy interactive widget). Never copy a whole widget back into this repo without explicit approval.
- `docs/Touchscreen_Design_Guidelines.md`: touch target sizing and UI design principles (local-only, gitignored, may be absent)

## Target Devices

### Xeneon Edge (dashboard_lcd)
- 2560x720 pixels, 32:9, 14.5" display, 183.40 PPI
- Capacitive touchscreen: interactive widgets are possible
- Restriction value: `dashboard_lcd`

#### Slot Sizes (Horizontal Orientation)
| Slot | Resolution | Aspect Ratio | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| HS   | 840x344   | ~2.44:1     | Short strip, limited vertical space |
| HM   | 840x696   | ~1.21:1     | Nearly square, most balanced layout |
| HL   | 1688x696  | ~2.43:1     | Wide, full height |
| HXL  | 2536x696  | ~3.64:1     | Near-full width |

#### Slot Sizes (Vertical Orientation)
| Slot | Resolution | Aspect Ratio |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| VS   | 696x416   | ~1.67:1     |
| VM   | 696x840   | ~0.83:1     |
| VL   | 696x1688  | ~0.41:1     |
| VXL  | 696x2536  | ~0.27:1     |

#### Responsive Breakpoints (common pattern)
- Wide (HS/HL/HXL): `@media (min-aspect-ratio: 200/100)` (aspect >= 2.0)
- HM: `@media (max-aspect-ratio: 150/100) and (min-aspect-ratio: 90/100)` (square-ish, ~1.2:1)
- Portrait (VM/VL/VXL): `@media (max-aspect-ratio: 90/100)` (all vertical orientations)
- Very tall (VL/VXL): `@media (max-aspect-ratio: 50/100)` (refinement of portrait)
- VS (1.67:1) typically falls between wide and HM; handle via default or dedicated query

#### Layout Naming Convention
- **H** prefix = horizontal orientation, **V** prefix = vertical orientation
- **S/M/L/XL** without H or V prefix refers to both horizontal and vertical layouts of that size
- Examples: "HS" = horizontal small, "VL" = vertical large, "M" = both HM and VM

#### Key Design Rules
- Touch targets: minimum 44x44px (2.42mm at 183.40 PPI per Touchscreen_Design_Guidelines.md)
- Use viewport units (vh, vw, vmin) for all sizing; never px or rem for layout elements
- S slot is half the height of M/L/XL (344 vs 696): double vh values in S to match physical sizes
- **IMPORTANT: iCUE preview renders at scaled-down resolution but preserves aspect ratio.** Previews scale by ~2.66x to ~8.0x depending on zoom level. Never use `min-height`/`max-height` breakpoints - use only `min-aspect-ratio`/`max-aspect-ratio` so the preview layout matches the actual layout.
- Actual viewports are 1px larger than documented slot sizes in each dimension (e.g., HS is 841x345, not 840x344). Aspect ratios are unaffected.
- Key aspect ratios: HS (2.44), HL (2.43), HXL (3.64), VS (1.67), HM (1.21), VM (0.83), VL (0.41), VXL (0.27)
- **ALWAYS add `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;` to the body CSS.** Without this, iCUE's Chromium engine shows a dark overlay flash on tap/click interactions.

### Keyboard LCD (keyboard_lcd)
- 320x170 px display, 1.9" LCD (sidebars consume 72px horizontally)
- Widget viewport: 248x170 px, ~1.46:1 aspect ratio
- Framerate: 2-4 FPS (animated widgets impractical)
- No touchscreen
- Restriction value: `keyboard_lcd` (official spec; older iCUE versions may have used `keyboard`)
- Used by: Corsair VANGUARD series keyboards

### Pump LCD (pump_lcd)
- 480x480 pixels, 1:1, 2.1" display, 323.25 PPI
- No touchscreen: widgets must be non-interactive or auto-cycling
- Design within a circle: content outside ~85% radius may be clipped
- Restriction value: `pump_lcd`

## Project Structure

```
EA-ICUE-Widgets/
  CLAUDE.md         This file
  README.md         Widget catalog and install instructions
  widgets/          All widgets (one EA{PascalCase} folder each)
  tools/            Build, screenshot, manifest, and icon-generation scripts
  dist/             Release ZIP output (gitignored)
  private/          Private widgets, never committed (gitignored; see "Private Widgets" below)
  .github/          CI workflows (release.yml)
```

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT create new widgets without explicit user approval.

Each widget follows this structure:
```
widgets/EA{WidgetName}/
  index.html                       # main widget file (single self-contained HTML)
  manifest.json                    # widget metadata (id, name, devices, interactive flag, version)
  translation.json                 # i18n strings
  icon.png, icon@2x.png            # 256/512 PNG icons for Marketplace listing (tracked despite *.png ignore rule)
  resources/
    ea-{widget-name}.svg           # widget picker icon (monochromatic white per Marketplace rules)
  modules/                         # optional: .mjs ES modules referenced from manifest "modules" key
    *.mjs
  README.md                        # widget documentation (optional)
```

Device compatibility is encoded in each widget's `manifest.json` (`supported_devices`) and HTML via `x-icue-restriction` meta tags.

Widgets that ship companion software (`EAClaudeUsage/server/ClaudeUsageServer.pyw`) get packaged as separate ZIPs by `tools/build-release.sh`. Companion servers expose `http://localhost:<port>` with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`; widgets poll them with `fetch()`.

## Private Widgets

Widgets that must not be shared live under `private/` (gitignored; the repo may become public). The tree mirrors the public one:

```
private/
  README.md         Layout and workflow notes
  manifests.js      Manifest entries for private widgets (same shape as the array in tools/generate-manifests.js)
  widgets/EA*/      Private widget folders, same structure as widgets/EA*/
  dist/             Build output for private widgets
```

Every tool takes `--private` to operate on this tree instead of `widgets/`:

```
node tools/generate-manifests.js --private   # reads private/manifests.js
node tools/generate-icons.js --private       # renders every private/widgets/EA*/ (flat primary color)
tools/build-release.sh --private             # writes private/dist/EA*.icuewidget; skips the companion server
node tools/screenshot.js private/widgets/EAFoo/index.html L
```

Rules:
- Never move, copy, or reference a private widget in `widgets/`, `README.md`, `tools/generate-manifests.js`, or `tools/generate-icons.js` without explicit approval. Publishing one means moving its folder to `widgets/` and its manifest entry into the public array.
- Private widgets follow every design and API rule in this file; only their location differs.
- CI never sees `private/`, so private widgets are never part of a release.

## Widget Inventory

### Xeneon Edge (1 widget)
| Widget | Folder | Interactive | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Claude Usage | EAClaudeUsage | No | Claude Code token/cost meter; polls `server/ClaudeUsageServer.pyw` on localhost:16330 |

## iCUE Widget Technical Notes

### Widget API Essentials
- Properties defined via `<meta name="x-icue-property">` tags. The `content` attribute (property variable name) must use **Latin letters and digits only** — no underscores, hyphens, or special characters.
- Groups defined via `<script type="application/json" id="x-icue-groups">`
- Lifecycle: `icueEvents = { onICUEInitialized: fn, onDataUpdated: fn }` (bare assignment, no `var`)
- Properties become global variables (e.g., `data-default="'#FFD700'"` -> `accentColor = '#FFD700'`)
- Translation: `tr('string key')` returns a Promise. **`translation.json` MUST use nested `"translation"` key** per language: `{"en": {"translation": {"Key": "Value"}}}`. Flat format `{"en": {"Key": "Value"}}` causes silent widget rejection.
- **The `"en"` translation section MUST contain all keys.** An empty `"en": {"translation": {}}` causes iCUE to flood `Default language not found` warnings for every property label, which can crash iCUE. English is the default/fallback language — always populate it with key=value pairs (e.g., `"Text Color": "Text Color"`).
- Interactive widgets need BOTH `<meta name="x-icue-interactive">` in the HTML AND `"interactive": true` in `manifest.json`. The manifest field is the canonical source per the official spec.
- **NEVER use `'use strict'`**: iCUE injects property values via `eval(backend.data)` which assigns bare globals. Strict mode breaks this mechanism in Qt WebEngine, causing properties to not be injected, settings to not apply, and interactive widgets to become unresponsive.
- **NEVER use `var icueEvents` or `var iCUE_initialized`**: Use bare assignment (`icueEvents = {...}`) so iCUE's bootstrap can find the object. Declaring `iCUE_initialized` with `var` overwrites the flag set by iCUE's bootstrap.
- **Prefer `tab-buttons` over `combobox`** for any setting with a small set of options (2-5 choices). Tab-buttons always display the selected option visually, avoiding blank-state issues.
- **Combobox `data-values` MUST use `key/value` format**, not `title/value`. Only `key/value` (`[{'key':'Foo','value':tr('Foo')}, ...]`) and plain string arrays are documented formats. `title/value` is unsupported and results in a blank dropdown. Reserve combobox for large option lists (e.g., timezone pickers) where tab-buttons would be impractical.
- **Slider `data-step` is REQUIRED.** Always include `data-min`, `data-max`, and `data-step` together on every slider property. Missing `data-step` causes silent iCUE import validation failure — the widget will not appear in the picker.
- **`media-selector` `data-filters` is REQUIRED.** Always include `data-filters` on every `media-selector` property. Without it, the entire widget is silently rejected from the picker. Use `data-filters="['*.png','*.jpg','*.jpeg','*.webp']"` for images (add `'*.webm','*.mp4','*.mkv','*.gif'` etc. for video support). Do NOT include `data-default=""` — omit `data-default` entirely for media-selector.
- Fonts: **Jost is the EA project typeface** (a project convention for visual consistency — iCUE itself allows any locally packaged or system font). Do not use other fonts in EA widgets. Jost (variable, weights 100-900) is embedded as base64 woff2 in each HTML file (~35KB). To embed it in a new widget, copy the full `@font-face` block (including the base64 payload and SIL license comment) from `widgets/EAClaudeUsage/index.html`. Weight hierarchy: 700 for headings/numbers, 600 for body/labels, 400 for secondary text.
- The `x-icue-widget-preview` meta tag is not used in the iCUE widget picker, but **is** used on the Marketplace listing page. Expected size: **128x56 pixels** (PNG preferred). Not needed for local install; required for Marketplace submissions.
- **NEVER call `getUserMedia()`**: it exists in the webview but hangs indefinitely — no permission dialog appears and the widget freezes. There is no system audio capture path from inside a widget.
- `navigator.mediaSession.metadata` is always `null` in the webview. Reading other apps' Now Playing info is not possible.
- **`iCUE.fpsLimit`** (default: 30) is a readable property for checking the current frame rate cap.
- **Interactive widget focus:** When the iCUE desktop app is open (not minimized to tray), touching a widget steals focus from the user's active application. When iCUE is in the system tray, this does not occur.
- **Device feature targeting:** The `supported_devices` array in `manifest.json` supports an optional `features` key (e.g., `"features": ["sensor-screen"]`) to restrict a widget to devices with specific capabilities beyond device type.
- **Module integration:** `.mjs` files declared in `manifest.json` under `"modules"` can export synchronous functions that are callable inside `data-default` and `data-values` expressions (e.g., `data-default="SystemUtils.getCurrentTimezone()"`). Only synchronous/blocking functions work in these expressions — async functions cannot be used.
- **`media-selector` codec support:** On Windows, AV1/VP8/VP9 video is supported. On macOS, video codecs are not supported — use images only for cross-platform media widgets.
- **Marketplace:** The iCUE Marketplace currently accepts Xeneon Edge (`dashboard_lcd`) widgets only. Key constraints: all code must be human-readable (no obfuscation), no hardcoded API keys, `tr()` required on all `data-label` and `<title>`, 4.5:1 minimum text contrast, no flashing >3×/sec, max 10 API calls/sec.

### Required Settings Pattern (Xeneon Edge widgets)

Every Xeneon Edge widget (including "both" widgets) MUST have a Widget Personalization property group following the official iCUE pattern.

**IMPORTANT: iCUE rejects groups with empty `"properties": []` arrays and unknown property types (e.g., `hidden`).** A group must contain at least one property with a valid type. The widget will not appear in iCUE at all if either condition is violated.

**Group 1: Widget Name** (required)
- Houses the Size selector (S/M/L/XL) which iCUE provides natively as the first group
- MUST contain `customTitle` (textfield, default `''`) as the LAST property: when non-empty, displays the user's text centered at the top of the widget (useful for labeling, screenshots, and showcases)
- May contain additional widget-specific settings (e.g., grid size, timer options) before `customTitle`
- The `customTitle` property ensures Group 1 always has at least one property, which is required for iCUE to enable the Custom Style toggle on Group 2

**Group 2: Widget Personalization** (the Custom Style toggle ONLY appears on the second settings group — this is why Personalization must be Group 2)
- Property order follows the official iCUE widget pattern:
  - backgroundMedia (media-selector): background image. **MUST include `data-filters`** — omit `data-default`
  - glassBlur (slider 0-30, default 0): background blur effect
  - textColor (color): main text color
  - accentColor (color): highlights and accents
  - *widget-specific colors* (e.g., moonColor, warmColor) go here
  - backgroundColor (color): widget background
  - transparency (slider 0-100, default 100): background transparency. **Value semantics match iCUE convention: 100 = fully opaque, 0 = fully transparent.**
- When color properties exist in a second group, iCUE automatically renders a "Custom Style" toggle
- When Custom Style is OFF, the widget inherits Device Personalization colors
- When Custom Style is ON, the user can override with per-widget values
- Canvas-only widgets without text may omit textColor

**Text styling rules:**
- NEVER use transparent or semi-transparent text. All text must be a solid, fully opaque color for readability.

**Transparency behavior by device:**
- **Xeneon Edge**: The Appearance -> Transparency setting ONLY affects the widget background color opacity. It must NOT affect text, canvas trails, or other visual elements.
- **Pump LCD**: Transparency has no effect since there is no background layer behind the pump LCD other than the widget's own background color. The setting exists for DP compatibility but is functionally inert.

Background transparency (XE) is applied via:
```css
background-color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--bg-color), transparent calc((1 - var(--widget-opacity)) * 100%));
```

The JS conversion from slider value to CSS variable:
```javascript
root.style.setProperty('--widget-opacity', cfg.transparency / 100);
```
This maps transparency=100 (default) to opacity 1.0 (fully opaque) and transparency=0 to opacity 0.0 (fully transparent), matching iCUE's built-in widget convention.

### Standalone Testing
Widgets include a two-part fallback for testing outside iCUE:
```javascript
icueEvents = {
    "onICUEInitialized": onInit,
    "onDataUpdated": readSettings
};

// iCUE already initialized before script ran
if (typeof iCUE_initialized !== 'undefined' && iCUE_initialized) {
    onInit();
}

// Standalone fallback (outside iCUE)
if (typeof iCUE_initialized === 'undefined') { onInit(); }
```

### Tooling

All scripts run from repo root.

**Screenshots** — render widgets at any slot size via puppeteer:
```
node tools/screenshot.js <widget.html> [S|M|L|XL|VS|VM|VL|VXL|PUMP|KB]
```
- `KB` = keyboard LCD (248x170)
- `--eval "<js>"` injects JS before capture, e.g. `--eval "cfg.heroMetric='tokens'; render(lastData);"`
- `--delay <ms>` controls post-eval wait (default 500ms)
- Preview-scale slots (`PS`, `PM`, `PL`, ...) also exist for testing the iCUE preview path

**Manifest generation** — regenerate every widget's `manifest.json`:
```
node tools/generate-manifests.js
```
Per-widget metadata (id, name, description, devices, interactive, modules) lives inside the script as a JS array. Edit the array to change a manifest, then re-run.

**Icon generation** — regenerate `icon.png` and `icon@2x.png` from each widget's SVG:
```
node tools/generate-icons.js
```
PNGs use the brand palette on dark `#4f5458` background. Brand colors: primary `#f84bff` (magenta), secondary `#009bff` (blue), tertiary `#ffae30` (amber). SVG picker icons stay monochromatic white per Marketplace rules. Per-widget color overrides live in the script's `colorize()` function.

**Release build** — package every shippable widget into a ZIP:
```
tools/build-release.sh
```
Scans `widgets/EA*/`, packages each dir that contains an `index.html`, writes per-widget ZIPs and `.icuewidget` files, plus an `all-widgets-{tag}.zip` bundle to `dist/`. Also packages `widgets/EAClaudeUsage/server/` as `ClaudeUsageServer.zip`.

**IMPORTANT: Always build a `.icuewidget` file after modifying a widget** so the user can import and test it in iCUE. A `.icuewidget` is a flat ZIP of the widget folder contents:
```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path "widgets\EA{Name}\*" -DestinationPath "dist\EA{Name}.icuewidget" -Force
```

## Naming Conventions
- All widget names prefixed with "EA" (Edward Ayoub)
- Folder names: `EA{PascalCase}`
- HTML files: `index.html`
- Translation files: `translation.json`
- SVG icons: `ea-{kebab-case}.svg` (in `resources/`)

## Installation
Widgets are installed by importing `.icuewidget` files through iCUE's **+** button (or by double-clicking the file in Explorer — the file type is associated with iCUE), or by copying widget folders to iCUE's widgets directory:
`C:\Program Files\Corsair\Corsair iCUE5 Software\widgets`
- Each widget folder (e.g., `EAClaudeUsage/`) goes directly under `widgets/`
- Widgets imported via the **+** button take effect immediately — no iCUE restart needed (as of mid-2026 iCUE versions). Directly copied widget folders may still require a restart.
- For local testing, build straight to `dist/` (`tools/build-release.sh`) and import from there — no need to copy artifacts elsewhere.

### Releases
- Triggered by pushing a tag matching `v*` (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- CI runs `tools/build-release.sh`, which packages every `widgets/EA*/` dir containing an `index.html`. To exclude a widget from a release, remove or rename its `index.html` (or move it out of `widgets/`).
- Per-widget: `EA{PascalCase}.zip` (folder-wrapped) + `EA{PascalCase}.icuewidget` (flat, for iCUE import)
- All-widgets bundle: `all-widgets-{tag}.zip`
- Companion server: `ClaudeUsageServer.zip`
- Release notes are auto-generated from commit messages between the previous tag and the new tag (Co-Authored-By lines stripped, capped at 50 commits)
- Install link: `[Releases](https://github.com/edwardayoub/EA-ICUE-Widgets/releases)` (repo is public; keep anything not meant to be shared under `private/`)

### Versioning

**Per-widget version (in each widget's `manifest.json`):**
- **x (major)**: Breaking changes (removed settings, changed behavior that would surprise existing users)
- **y (minor)**: New features or visible changes (new settings, layout improvements, UI changes)
- **z (patch)**: Bug fixes, performance tweaks, code cleanup with no visible change

To bump versions in bulk, edit `tools/generate-manifests.js` and re-run it.

**Release tags:**
- Date-based: `v2026.03`, `v2026.03.1` (multiple releases in same month)
- A release packages ALL widgets in `widgets/EA*/` at their current versions
- Multiple widget updates can ship in a single release

### Update Workflow
1. Make changes and commit to main (as many commits as needed). Commit messages will become the release notes — write them accordingly.
2. Bump the `version` field in each changed widget's `manifest.json` (or update `tools/generate-manifests.js` and re-run it).
3. Push a tag (e.g., `v2026.03.1`) to trigger CI and publish the release.
